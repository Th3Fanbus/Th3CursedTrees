# Th3Fanbus' Cursed Trees

## This is a silly mod. It is not meant to be balanced or make sense.

This is my first Satisfactory mod. It currently adds one Tier 4 HUB Milestone that unlocks a Coal Tree, a building which produces about 480 Coal per minute. Out of nowhere. It is based on the idea that Santa gives coal to bad kids. The tree is meant to be available at any time of the year, not just during FICSMAS.

### Thanks
